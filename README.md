# Freight-Frenzy-2021-2022-robot-code

This is our teams robot code for Freight Frenzy. <br />
This incudle codes for both blue & red alliance, and our teleop codes. <br />
Some files contain codes for object dection for a simple red solo cup. (only 1 camera at the front of the robot) <br />
Code are not really optimized, and the robot run kind of slow, suggestion would be to add motor braking. <br />
