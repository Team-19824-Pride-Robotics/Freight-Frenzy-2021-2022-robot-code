# Freight-Frenzy-2021-2022-robot-code

This is our teams robot code for Freight Frenzy._
This incudle codes for both blue & red alliance, and our teleop codes._
Some files contain codes for object dection for a simple red solo cup. (only 1 camera at the front of the robot)_
Code are not really optimized, and the robot run kind of slow, suggestion would be to add motor braking._
